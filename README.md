# Appium-Mobile-Project-Java

A simple repo that has appium tests.

- Navigate to each test inside the src directory.
- Each part will have the before and after class.
- In order to run the test:
    - Make sure you have your Appium server running
    - Make sure you have your Android imltr running
 - To run the test, click the arrow next to the @Test
    - That should trigger your Appium server to connect
     to the app and perform the test

*Please be advised that the app might have been changed and/or redesigned,
so it's a good idea to make sure the selectors you are using are still the same.

Happy Testing.
