#### A simple repo that has appium tests

* Navigate to each test inside the src directory.
* In order to run the test if you are running them on a simulator or an emulator on your local machine:
    * Make sure you have your Appium server running
    * Make sure you have your Android emulator or iOS simulator running
 * To run the test, click the arrow next to the @Test
    * That should trigger your Appium server to connect
     to the app and perform the test
     
#### If you are running a test on Sauce Labs using a virtual device OR RDC

   * Make sure you have your own APP storage added.
   * Run the test by simply clicking on the green arrow

*Please be advised that the app the tests run against might have been changed and/or redesigned,
so it's a good idea to make sure the selectors you are using are still the same.

If anything, this repo is just an example of how you can set up simple tests to test your app.

Happy Testing.
